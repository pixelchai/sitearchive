There seems to be some confusion with what the adjective derivative of "Nepal" is. Some use the word "Nepali" while others use "Nepalese". So which one is it?

According to Google, it's "Nepali". That's what the language is labeled as in Google Translate. It's a really *REALLY* bad idea trying to generalise the whole Nepali/Nepalese language like Google is, by the way, and it just *wont work*. But anyway, that's a topic for another time. 

Ok let me be blunt: It is definetly *not* "Nepali". "Why" you ask? Take a look at the list of languages that Google Translate supports (how well they are supported, however, is another matter). It says "German" instead of "Deustch", "French" instead of "Francais", "Japanese" instead of "Nihongo" etc... It's pretty safe to deduct that this is a list of the English names for languages. We have among these labels, one which reads "Nepali". Allow me to educate you all:

"Nepali" is actually a word in the Nepalese language which is used to refer to the language spoken by the Nepalese people.
