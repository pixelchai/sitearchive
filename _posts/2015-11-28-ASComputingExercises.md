So here's an explanation of what these posts are all about and why I made them.

All of posts in this section will be my answers to exercises from a textbook:
> AQA Computing AS level - Kerboodle by Sylvia Langfield and Kevin Bond

The book, I feel, teaches a much more basic level of computing knowledge than that I already own and the exercises are similar to the stuff I was making nore than 3 years ago, when my computing knowledge was much more limited. Even so, I will work through the book because I have never really looked at coding/computing in an acadamic sense before - I learnt all the knowledge I have about coding today from making random projects and experimenting a lot. I did coding simply because I thought it was very interesting and fun. Another reason for going through this book anyway would be because I was not able to find any higher level books in my school library, from which I got this book.

In all of the exercises that I do complete in this book, I aim to write appropriate comments and give appropriate names to variables. Since I learnt coding just by experimenting, I don't usually write comments and I often use variablenames that other coders may not understand. I will make it so that the code for these exercises are easily understandable by other coders and I will refrain from using confusing indentations. i.e, no more of this (not that it is in my coding that much anyway):

{% highlight csharp %}
Console.WriteLine(
new foo((
banana+1)/(
(moo)-(noo)).method(banana,(foo/loo),gaaaaa)
).Get()
)
{% endhighlight %}

In adition, I shall make the programs that I make in this section as efficient as possible, which has never been THAT high of a priority for me (it was prioritised, just not as the _highest_ priority).

NB: The answers to the exercises will be completed in __C#__
