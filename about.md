This website, which started development in 11/18/2015, explains/rants about/highlights all the cool stuff that I rather arbitarilly get an urge to write/make when within a certain radius from a computer.

Games, Code, How Tos, Language, Music, 3D Modeling and Animating, General Art, Literature, etc. Anything that I, and hopefully you, find interesting. Tip - look at the menu to see all of the topics that I have talked about on this website.

And now to enter the crazy world that is this website, good luck!
