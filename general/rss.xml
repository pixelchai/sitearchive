<p>Gaunilo was one of the earliest critics of Anselm’s ontological argument. Gaunilo doesn’t really specify any fault with the argument itself but argued that the argument is incorrect due to it’s genericity - i.e “God” can be replaced by almost anything.</p>

<p>When I heard about Anselm’s Argument for the first time, I must admit - I immediately had a revelation about the “Greatest Cookie Possible” - i.e the “Cookie than which no greater can exist”. I experienced an epiphany that this cookie would be even greater if it existed in the real world and not in just my imagination. In fact, it would be much better if it was right in front of me and I could eat it. As I reached to take a bite, I awoke from the false reality I had created and rather than a giant, heavenly cookie, I was greeted with curious expressions from my classmates.</p>

<p>This must have been how Gaunilo felt when he envisioned a perfect island. Gaunilo says that according to Anselm’s argument, the island (or, if you prefer, giant cookie) must exist. Since it does not actually exist, this must mean that Anselm’s argument is incorrect.</p>

<p>Well clearly this is one of the weaker negatives of the argument since - especially in my argument for the existence of the “Cookie than which no greater can exist” - the definition of greatness is subjective. I stated, for example, that “it would be much better if it was right in front of me and I could eat it”. This is better for me but definitely not better for the cookie.</p>

	     <p>This is my first ever proper website.  I have never before done much HTML coding at all. This is my first time using ` Ruby ` too. This website was created with  <code>Jekyll </code> . <strong>x_x</strong></p>

<p>I am however, quite experienced with object-orientated coding languages - if I do say so myself. I’ve been coding ever since I can remember, my language of choice, currently being C# &amp; JAVA. I’ve been doing C# for the best part of 2 or 3 years now.</p>

<p>Anyway, expect these pages to be filled with any data that I can document. Expect games, code, 3D models, concept art, music - all the weird and wonderful products from a person that has, in recent years,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>turned away from those leaves, which about tornadoes flurry,<br />
 towards the midnight ocean vast.<br />
 To the intricately produced gray-faced words which along scurry,<br />
 having, unyieldingly, been executed fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woah my writing formed a poem…</p>
