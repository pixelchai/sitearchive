	     <p>This is my 2nd ever proper website.  I have never before done much HTML coding at all. This is my first time using ` Ruby ` too. This website was created with  <code>Jekyll </code> . <strong>x_x</strong></p>

<p>I am however, quite experienced with object-orientated coding languages - if I do say so myself. I’ve been coding ever since I can remember, my language of choice, currently being C# &amp; JAVA. I’ve been doing C# for the best part of 2 or 3 years now.</p>

<p>Anyway, expect these pages to be filled with any data that I can document. Expect games, code, 3D models, concept art, music - all the weird and wonderful products from a person that has, in recent years,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>turned away from those leaves, which about tornadoes flurry,<br />
 towards the midnight ocean vast.<br />
 To the intricately produced gray-faced words which along scurry,<br />
 having, unyieldingly, been executed fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woah my writing formed a poem…</p>
